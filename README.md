Salary Prediction Project

This project predicts salaries based on experience using Machine Learning (Linear Regression).
It is part of my IBM PBEL Internship submission.

📂 Project Structure

salary_data.csv → Dataset (Years of Experience vs Salary)

salary_prediction.py → Main Python script (training + prediction)

models/ → Saved trained model

graphs/ → Visualization plots (Salary vs Experience)

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/VisheshDubey26/salary-prediction-project.git
